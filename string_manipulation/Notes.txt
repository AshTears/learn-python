1. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. 
2. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes.
3. Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. 
4. An argument is an object or an expression passed to a function â€” added between the opening and closing parentheses.
5. Each string character can be referenced by a numerical index. The index count starts at zero.
6. You can access the number of characters in a string with the built-in len() function.
7. 
    -Some words are reserved keywords (e.g. for, while, True). They have a special meaning in Python, so you cannot use them for variable names.
    -Variable names cannot start with a number, and they can only contain alpha-numeric characters or underscores.
    -Variable names are case sensitive, i.e. my_var is different from my_Var and MY_VAR.
    -Finally, it is a common convention to write variable names using snake_case, where each space is replaced by an underscore character and the words are written in lowercase letters.
8. A loop allows you to systematically go through a sequence of elements and execute actions on each one.
